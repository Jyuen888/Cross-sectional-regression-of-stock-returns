# Cross-sectional regression of stock returns
This project is an exercise to replicate the Lewellen (2015) paper on cross sectional regression analysis of expected stock returns for acadamic learning purpose.

We perform monthly cross-sectional regression analysis of stock returns in 3 regression models of predictors (or characteristics):
- Model 1: size, B/M, past 12-month stock returns
- Model 2: Characteristics from Model 1 + three-year share issuance and one-year accruals, ROA (profitability), and asset
growth
- Model 3: Characteristics from Model 1 and 2 + dividend yield, three-year stock returns, one-year share issuance, 12-month
turnover, market leverage, and the sales-to-price ratio
